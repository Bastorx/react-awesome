# **react-awesome**

**_A generator for a complete react app. Include (React, Redux, React-Router, i18next, Jest, Eslint, Flow, Webpack, ES6+ (Babel)...)_**

## **How it works**

React Awesome try to use the best package to start a React App.

> **React Awesome include :**

* [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/docs/)
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
* [React-Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)
* [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)
* [I18next](https://www.i18next.com/) _Translation package_

**Dev tools**

* [BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/docs)
* [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest/)
* [Flow](https://flow.org/)
* [Eslint](https://eslint.org/)
* [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)

> **Commands**

* Launch a development server

  `npm run dev`

* Build a production bundle

  `npm run build`

* Launch a production server

  `npm start`

* Launch test with flow, jest and lint !

  `npm test`

* Launch jest

  `npm run jest`

* Launch jest with watch parameters (useful to update snapshot)

  `npm run jest:watch`

* Launch jest

  `npm run flow`

* Launch lint

  `npm run lint`

## **Get started**

To start, edit the file in src/containers/App.js

    const App = () => (
      <Provider store={store}>
        <I18nextProvider i18n={i18n}>
          <Router>
            <Switch>
              <Route
                path="/"
                render={() => <h1>{i18n.t("global:hello-world")}</h1>}
              />
            </Switch>
          </Router>
        </I18nextProvider>
      </Provider>
    );

You can also start to edit files in translations folder.

## **You should know**

Server (in development and production), render the folder public in a static path /assets, you can load file by 2 ways

**Best way:**

        <img
          alt="kitten"
          src={require("../public/images/kitten.jpg")}
        />

**Other way:**

        <img
          alt="kitten"
          src="/assets/images/kitten.jpg"
        />

## **Advice**

* Keep the window-state in the redux-store could be useful.
* Keep the AppPromise, without it promise the app could be loaded before translation. Don't forget that Google use the first rendering for referencing. If you don't need i18next, you could update app.js

      	    AppPromise().then(() => {
      		    ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("app"));
      	    });

To

    ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("app"));

* Husky is a great package to writte some hooks in package.json. I recommend to keep it.
